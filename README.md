## Computer Vision

These are a collection of algorithms/problems likely to be asked in Computer Vision based coding interviews, partly taken from this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/7gku4z/technical_interview_questions_in_cv/)

1. [Apply a Box filter over an image, given an Image class]() | [Code]()

1. [Harris corner detector, given an Image class]() | [Code]()
